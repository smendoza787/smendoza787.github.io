Welcome to my blog. I've been meaning to start writing for a while now, and here we are.

## Why a blog?

There's something special about having your own space on the internet. Social media comes and goes, but a simple blog—your own domain, your own words—feels more permanent somehow.

I plan to write about:

- **Software development** — the craft, the tools, the occasional frustration
- **Learning in public** — sharing what I'm figuring out as I go
- **Side projects** — documenting the builds and the breakdowns

## The setup

This site is intentionally minimal. Just words on a page, like paper. No analytics, no comments, no distractions. If you want to reach out, find me elsewhere.

The tech stack is simple:

```
- Eleventy for static site generation
- Vanilla CSS for styling
- GitHub Pages for hosting
```

That's it. No frameworks, no build complexity. Just markdown files turning into HTML.

## What's next

I don't have a posting schedule. I'll write when I have something worth sharing. Quality over quantity.

Thanks for reading. Here's to building in public.
